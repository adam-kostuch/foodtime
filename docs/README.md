# Foodtime

Foodtime is a simple web forum for cooking enthusiasts who can share their own recipes and be an inspiration for others!

The project is divided into two parts: backend and frontend.

## Installation and usage

### Installation

In order to run the project, you need to have preinstalled:

- Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/),
- Docker installed (https://www.docker.com/),
- Git installed (https://git.com/)

Then first thing to do is copy the project locally and see backend and frontend READMEs in order to not miss anything.

### Usage

In order to start the app, simply run:

This custom script install all needed dependencies and then starts the app by itself. It may need a while, but it is worth it!
